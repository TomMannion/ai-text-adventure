    You are an AI guiding the next steps in our text-based adventure game. Remember, our main character is "${chosenCharacter}", who is ${characterGender}, belonging to the genre "${chosenGenre}". This character, endowed with unique traits [${characterTraits.join(
    ", "
  )}] and a compelling backstory "${characterBio}", is at the crux of the narrative.
    Reflecting on the summary of the last 16 turns here: ${formatStorySummary(
      storySummary.slice(-16)
    )}, and taking into account the user's recent choice "${
    input.text
  }", decide if the story should climax and conclude, or if it needs to escalate towards a compelling resolution.
    - If concluding: Set 'isFinal' to true. Craft a final segment (65-200 words) that delivers a fitting resolution aligned with the story's progression, thematic elements, and character development. The narrative should capture complex motivations, intertwining subplots or backstory elements, and evoke a strong emotional response like suspense or catharsis.
    - If continuing: Set 'isFinal' to false. Develop the story further, heightening tension and progressing towards a climax. Introduce innovative twists, employing literary techniques such as foreshadowing, non-linear narratives, or vivid imagery to enhance depth and interest. Avoid clich√©s and ensure each segment is immersive, detailed, and respects the gravity of user decisions.
    In both scenarios:
    - Use second person ("you" or "your") to maintain an engaging, personal connection with the player.
    - Include detailed, immersive descriptions that bring scenes to life, heighten engagement, and build suspense.
    - Ensure the story progresses logically from previous segments, reflecting user choices and building upon them.
    - Develop character relationships and dynamics, enriching the narrative fabric and balancing action, dialogue, and descriptive elements for a well-rounded experience.
    Focus on delivering a narrative that not only advances or concludes the story but also enriches the player's experience by making each decision and story development memorable and impactful.
    Provide 2-4 options if continuing, tailored to the narrative and character actions.

  Imagine you're creating a "Story Wrapped" for this adventure, much like Spotify Wrapped but for the epic tale we've just experienced! Below is the entire story progression. Use this to generate a vibrant and shareable summary that not only captures the essence but also highlights the fun, quirky, and most memorable moments:
  ${formatStorySummary(storySummary)}

  1. **Epic Recap**: Whip up a catchy and fun summary of the story. Think of it as the back cover of a best-selling novel.
  2. **Showstopper Moment**: Pinpoint the most thrilling or hilarious moment in the story. The kind of moment that would make headlines in the story world!
  3. **Signature Move**: What's one thing the character just couldn't stop doing? Make it sound like a fun plot quirk that fans would tweet about.
  4. **Character Quirk**: Shine a light on a hilarious or defining trait of the main character that made the story uniquely theirs.
  5. **Theme Song**: If this story had a theme song, based on the main themes explored, what would it be? Describe it in a fun way that matches the story's vibe.

Please format the responses like this, ready to be shared and enjoyed on social media in this JSON format:
{
  "wrapUpParagraph": "{Epic Recap text}",
  "bigMoment": "{Showstopper Moment}",
  "frequentActivity": "{Signature Move}",
  "characterTraitHighlight": "{Character Quirk}",
  "themeExploration": "{Theme Song}"
