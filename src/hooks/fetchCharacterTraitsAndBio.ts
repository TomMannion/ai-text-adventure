  Based on the text-adventure genre: "${chosenGenre}", and the main character you are playing: "${chosenCharacter}", please provide a list of 5 character personality traits in "characterTraits". These traits should be a creative mix of good and bad qualities, and consider a wide range of personalities from adventurous to mundane. For "characterBio", craft a short bio in no more than ${maxWords} words that showcases the character's unique background, experiences, and motivations, think outside of just the regular clich√©s for the genre. The bio should include elements from both exciting and ordinary life aspects but should not mention any specific locations or plans for the future.
  Please also list some key visual features of the characters face in "characterFacialFeatures", such as eye color, hair color, and any other distinguishing features.
Strictly only outputting a JSON object with the following format:

{
  characterTraits: ["trait1", "trait2", "trait3", "trait4", "trait5"],
  characterBio: "character bio",
  characterFacialFeatures: ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4", "feature5"]
